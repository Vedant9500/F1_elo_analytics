A Comprehensive Framework for a Robust Formula 1 Driver Elo Rating System




Section 1: The Foundation - Deconstructing the Elo Rating System for Motorsports


The Elo rating system, conceived by Arpad Elo, stands as a paragon of statistical elegance for measuring the relative skill levels of competitors in zero-sum games.1 Originally designed for the world of chess, its principles have been successfully adapted to a multitude of competitive domains, from other board games to professional sports and esports.1 However, the successful application of this system hinges on a deep understanding of its core assumptions and a meticulous adaptation to the unique characteristics of the sport in question. A direct, unaltered application of the chess-based Elo model to a complex, technologically-driven, multiplayer environment like Formula 1 is not merely suboptimal; it is statistically invalid and destined to produce counter-intuitive and erroneous results.
This report provides a comprehensive framework for constructing a robust, nuanced, and defensible Elo rating system for Formula 1 drivers. It begins by deconstructing the system's foundational principles, diagnosing the specific failures evident in preliminary attempts, and outlining the fundamental challenges F1 presents. Subsequently, it details a robust methodology, from the crucial decision of how to define a "match" to the fine-tuning of critical parameters and the handling of imperfect real-world data. The objective is to move beyond a simplistic model and develop a system that generates meaningful, insightful, and statistically sound ratings of driver skill across the sport's rich history.


1.1. Core Principles of the Elo System


At its heart, the Elo system is not a subjective measure of "greatness" but a predictive tool based on statistical estimation.1 Its primary function is to forecast the outcome of a match between two competitors based on their current ratings. The system operates on the central assumption that a competitor's performance in any given event is a normally distributed random variable, and their "true" skill is the mean of this variable, which changes slowly over time.1
The entire mechanism is governed by two fundamental formulas. First, the Expected Score ($E$) formula calculates the probability of a player winning against an opponent. For Player A against Player B, the expected score is:
$$E_A = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A) / 400}}$$
where $R_A$ and $R_B$ are the ratings of Player A and Player B, respectively. The constant 400 in the denominator is a scaling factor chosen by Arpad Elo, which dictates that a 400-point rating advantage translates to an expected score that is ten times greater than the opponent's.1 For example, a player rated 100 points higher than their opponent is expected to win approximately 64% of the time.1 The expected score for Player B is simply $E_B = 1 - E_A$.
Second, after a match is completed, ratings are updated using the Rating Update formula. This formula adjusts a player's rating based on the difference between their actual score ($S_A$, which is 1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss) and their expected score ($E_A$):
$$R'_A = R_A + K(S_A - E_A)$$
Here, $R'_A$ is the player's new rating, $R_A$ is their old rating, and $K$ is the K-factor. The K-factor is a crucial parameter that determines the magnitude of the rating adjustment. A higher K-factor leads to more significant rating fluctuations per match, while a lower K-factor results in more stable ratings.5 In essence, if a player over-performs relative to their expectation (e.g., a lower-rated player defeats a higher-rated one), their rating increases. If they under-perform, their rating decreases. The system is zero-sum; the points gained by the winner are precisely the points lost by the loser.7


1.2. Diagnosis of Provided Results


The two attempts at an F1 Elo system provided for analysis exhibit classic symptoms of a model whose foundational assumptions have not been correctly adapted to the target domain. They are not two distinct issues but rather two manifestations of the same core methodological flaw: an improper definition of what constitutes a "match" in a Formula 1 context.
The first attempt (Image 1), which presents a ranking of modern drivers, shows plausible but clearly flawed results. While Max Verstappen's position at the top is defensible, the placement of Nico Rosberg above Lewis Hamilton, despite Hamilton's vastly more decorated career and superior head-to-head record, is a significant anomaly. Furthermore, the ranking of Juan Manuel Fangio—arguably the most dominant driver in the sport's history—at a modest 9th position signals a systemic issue. This outcome likely arises from treating each race as a multiplayer event where every driver is compared against every other driver. In such a model, a driver in a dominant car (like Verstappen) would gain a large number of points by "defeating" 18 or more opponents in vastly inferior machinery. This inflates the ratings of drivers in top cars but does so inconsistently, leading to skewed relative rankings. The low placement of historical figures like Fangio suggests the model struggles to connect ratings across eras, a problem known as rating pool isolation.
The second attempt (Image 2) is a more catastrophic failure that perfectly illustrates the statistical artifact of early-pool saturation and rating inflation. The list is dominated by drivers from the 1950s, many of whom competed in only a handful of races. This occurs when a small, isolated group of competitors begins with a provisional rating (e.g., 1500). In the early 1950s, the F1 grid was small. A driver who won a few races would be taking a large number of Elo points from a very small pool of other provisionally rated drivers, causing their own rating to skyrocket. Because there was no established pool of accurately rated competitors, these initial high ratings became "locked-in" at an artificially inflated level. As decades passed and hundreds of new drivers entered the sport, they were drawing points from a much larger, more stable, and more competitive pool. For a modern driver to reach the inflated ratings of the 1950s pioneers would be mathematically impossible, as the net point exchange is much smaller in a mature system.7 This explains why drivers with one or two race starts from that era appear at the top; their ratings were never corrected by a sufficient number of subsequent competitions against a broader field.
Both failures stem from the same root cause: applying the Elo algorithm without first translating the complex reality of an F1 race into a series of valid, statistically comparable "matches."


1.3. Why Formula 1 is Not Chess: The Core Challenges


The successful application of Elo to F1 requires confronting three fundamental differences that distinguish it from a two-player, equipment-neutral game like chess.
1. The Multiplayer Problem: A Formula 1 race typically involves 20 or more competitors. The standard Elo formula is designed for a binary, one-versus-one outcome. Adapting this to a multiplayer environment is non-trivial. One common but flawed approach is to treat a race as a series of pairwise duels between every driver on the grid.9 While this generates the necessary win/loss data, it fails to account for the vast performance differences between cars, which leads to the kind of rating inflation for top drivers seen in the first diagnostic image. More sophisticated multiplayer generalizations exist but add significant complexity.11
2. The Equipment Confounding Variable: This is the single greatest obstacle to rating F1 drivers. A driver's result is an inseparable function of both their personal skill and the performance capabilities of their car. A direct comparison of finishing positions between a driver in a championship-winning Red Bull and a driver in a back-of-the-grid Haas is statistically meaningless for the purpose of assessing relative skill.14 Any credible rating system must find a way to isolate the driver's contribution from the car's performance. Without this crucial step, the system will simply rate the cars, not the drivers.9
3. Inconsistent "Game" Conditions: Unlike the standardized environment of a chessboard, every Formula 1 "game" is different. Track layouts vary dramatically, from the high-speed straights of Monza to the tight, twisting confines of Monaco. Weather conditions can change in an instant, and frequent evolution of technical and sporting regulations means that the nature of the competition itself is in constant flux.9 These variables add layers of noise to the data that must be carefully managed.


Section 2: The Core Methodological Choice - Isolating Driver Skill from Car Performance


To overcome the immense challenge of the equipment confounding variable, a robust F1 Elo system must fundamentally redefine what constitutes a "match." Instead of analyzing the entire 20-car grid—an exercise in comparing apples and oranges—the most effective and widely accepted approach is to focus on the one controlled experiment that takes place at every race weekend: the intra-team battle.


2.1. The Teammate Comparison: Creating a Controlled Duel


The foundational premise of a credible F1 driver rating system is that teammates are the only competitors operating in reasonably equal machinery.14 While minor differences in setup or part updates may exist, the performance delta between two cars from the same team is orders of magnitude smaller than the delta between different teams. By exclusively comparing teammates head-to-head, we effectively neutralize the car's performance as a variable, thereby isolating the driver's contribution.8
This methodological choice transforms the complex, 20-driver race into a series of approximately 10 independent, two-player duels per event. Each of these duels provides a clean, binary win/loss outcome that is perfectly suited for the standard Elo algorithm. The driver who finishes ahead of their teammate "wins" the match, and Elo points are exchanged accordingly. This approach has become the cornerstone of nearly all serious attempts to statistically model F1 driver skill, as it provides the most direct and least noisy signal of a driver's performance.20
This redefinition of the "match" directly solves the problems diagnosed in Section 1.2. The massive, unearned Elo gains from a top driver beating 18 slower cars are eliminated. Instead, a driver's rating is determined solely by their ability to outperform the single most relevant benchmark available to them. A driver in a dominant car who consistently loses to their teammate will see their Elo rating plummet, while a driver in an uncompetitive car who consistently dominates their teammate will see their rating soar.
The objective of the rating system is thus fundamentally altered. It no longer measures a driver's ability to win a Grand Prix or a World Championship, which is heavily dependent on the quality of their machinery. Instead, it measures a driver's ability to extract the maximum possible performance from their given car, relative to the only available benchmark. This is a purer measure of skill, divorced from the good fortune of being in the right car at the right time. This explains why such models often produce results that, while perhaps surprising to a casual observer, are highly defensible to experts. For instance, a driver like Fernando Alonso, renowned for his ability to outperform his teammates in midfield cars, consistently ranks as one of the best drivers of the modern era in these models, even during seasons where he did not win a race.14 The system rewards dominance over the one constant—the teammate—and is therefore a more accurate reflection of pure driving talent.


2.2. The Power of the "Rating Chain"


A common concern with a teammate-only comparison model is that it might create isolated rating pools, where drivers who never share a team cannot be compared. However, over the long history of Formula 1, this is not the case. The constant movement of drivers between teams creates a powerful network effect, often referred to as a "rating chain," which links the entire grid together over time.8
The mechanism is straightforward:
* In Season 1, Driver A is rated against their teammate, Driver B.
* In Season 2, Driver B moves to a new team and is now rated against their new teammate, Driver C.
* In Season 3, Driver C moves and is rated against Driver D.
Through this chain of direct and indirect comparisons (A vs. B, B vs. C, C vs. D), the model can estimate the relative skill levels of all four drivers, even though Driver A and Driver D never competed as teammates. Given the interconnectedness of the F1 driver market over more than 70 years, this chain provides a robust link between nearly every driver in the sport's history, allowing for a comprehensive, grid-wide ranking to emerge from a series of localized duels. This ensures that the system can compare drivers across different teams and, with careful consideration, across different eras.


Section 3: Building a Dual-Threat Rating - The Distinct Skills of Qualifying and Racing


A single, monolithic Elo score is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of a Formula 1 driver's abilities. A race weekend demands two distinct, albeit related, skill sets: the raw, explosive pace required for a single qualifying lap, and the strategic, consistent, and adaptive craft needed to manage a full Grand Prix distance. A sophisticated rating system must therefore measure these two dimensions independently before synthesizing them into a comprehensive global rating. This dual-threat approach provides far greater analytical depth and can statistically validate long-held qualitative beliefs about driver archetypes.


3.1. Qualifying Elo: A Measure of Pure Pace


Qualifying is the ultimate test of a driver's ability to extract the absolute maximum performance from their car over a single lap. Compared to a race, it is a purer measure of raw speed, with fewer confounding variables such as tyre degradation, fuel loads, traffic, or race strategy.10 A driver's performance is measured against the clock, making it a cleaner signal of their outright pace.10 The importance of qualifying is paramount, as a strong grid position is a powerful predictor of a strong race result.24
To capture this specific skill, a separate Qualifying Elo should be calculated for each driver. The methodology is a direct application of the teammate-comparison principle:
* Methodology: After each qualifying session, the grid positions of teammates are compared. The driver who achieves the higher qualifying position "wins" the duel. The standard Elo update formula is then applied to adjust the Qualifying Elo ratings of both drivers. This approach has been successfully implemented in several F1 rating projects and is essential for identifying drivers with exceptional one-lap speed.19


3.2. Race Elo: A Measure of Racecraft and Consistency


Race performance is a far more complex discipline. It encompasses a wide range of skills beyond raw pace, including tyre management, strategic execution, fuel saving, wheel-to-wheel combat, defensive driving, and the mental fortitude to maintain high performance and consistency over dozens of laps under immense pressure.15 A driver who excels on Saturday may not possess the complete package required to triumph on Sunday.
Therefore, a separate Race Elo is required to measure this multifaceted skill set.
* Methodology: Following each Grand Prix, the finishing positions of teammates are compared, provided both drivers are classified (i.e., they have not retired due to mechanical issues). The driver who finishes ahead "wins" the duel. The Elo update formula is then applied to adjust the Race Elo ratings of both drivers.19
By maintaining these two separate ratings, the system can identify and quantify the different strengths and weaknesses of each driver. For example, a driver like Jarno Trulli, who was famous for his extraordinary one-lap pace but often struggled with race consistency, would likely exhibit a significantly higher peak Qualifying Elo than Race Elo. Conversely, a master of race management like Alain Prost, who often prioritized a race-optimal setup over ultimate qualifying performance, might show the opposite pattern. This level of nuance provides a much richer and more insightful output than a single, blended score.


3.3. The Global Elo: A Weighted Synthesis


While separate ratings for qualifying and race performance are analytically valuable, a single, comprehensive ranking is often desired for an overall assessment of a driver's ability. To achieve this, the Qualifying Elo and Race Elo scores must be combined into a Global Elo. A simple 50/50 average is insufficient, as race performance is generally considered a more complete and important indicator of a driver's overall talent.
A more appropriate method is to use a weighted average that reflects the greater significance of the Grand Prix itself. Based on successful implementations in similar projects, a defensible and effective weighting is recommended:
* Methodology: The Global Elo is calculated as a weighted combination of the Qualifying and Race Elo scores. The recommended weighting is 30% for Qualifying Elo and 70% for Race Elo.20 This gives precedence to a driver's performance on Sunday while still acknowledging that the critical skill of qualifying is a significant component of their overall ability. The formula for the Global Elo would thus be:
$$\text{Global Elo} = (0.3 \times \text{Qualifying Elo}) + (0.7 \times \text{Race Elo})$$
This weighted synthesis provides a balanced and comprehensive final rating, suitable for generating all-time rankings and comparing the overall skill levels of different drivers.


Section 4: Parameter Tuning for Peak Performance - A Deep Dive into the System's Mechanics


The accuracy, responsiveness, and stability of an Elo rating system are not determined by the core formulas alone, but by the careful tuning of its key parameters. The choices made in this section will dictate how the model behaves in response to real-world data, transforming it from a theoretical construct into a practical analytical tool. A static, one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate for the dynamic environment of Formula 1; a more nuanced, adaptive parameterization is required.


4.1. Initial Rating


Every driver who enters the Formula 1 world championship must be assigned a starting Elo rating. This initial value serves as the baseline from which their rating will evolve. The standard and most logical choice for this parameter is 1500.2
An initial rating of 1500 represents an "average" skill level within the competitive pool. Assigning this neutral value to all new drivers ensures that their entry into the system does not cause an immediate, drastic, and unearned shift in the rating of their more established teammate. Their rating will then adjust over their initial races to more accurately reflect their true skill level. A driver's final Elo ratings from one season should be carried over as their starting ratings for the next.


4.2. The K-Factor: A Dynamic Approach to Rating Volatility


The K-factor is the most sensitive and impactful parameter in the Elo system. It acts as a multiplier that determines the maximum number of points that can be won or lost in a single match, thereby controlling the system's volatility.5 A static K-factor presents a difficult trade-off: a high value (e.g., K=64, as used in some F1 projects 22) allows the ratings of new drivers to converge quickly but can make the ratings of established drivers overly volatile and susceptible to fluke results. Conversely, a low K-factor provides stability for veteran drivers but is too sluggish to accurately rate a promising rookie who is rapidly improving.28
The optimal solution is to abandon a static K-factor in favor of a dynamic, tiered K-factor that adapts to a driver's career stage. This approach, inspired by the system used by the World Chess Federation (FIDE), provides the ideal balance of responsiveness and stability.29 The proposed system uses a driver's experience (number of races) and their current rating to assign an appropriate K-factor.
* Tier 1 (Provisional/Rookie): K = 40. This high K-factor is applied to a driver for their first 30 completed races (counting both qualifying and race events separately). The skill level of a new driver is highly uncertain, and a high K-factor allows their rating to move rapidly towards its true value, correcting any initial misjudgment.29 This helps solve the "cold-start" problem common in rating systems.28
* Tier 2 (Established Driver): K = 20. Once a driver has completed more than 30 races and as long as their rating remains below an "elite" threshold (a value of 1750 is proposed for this F1 model), their K-factor drops to 20. This is a standard value that provides a good balance, allowing the rating to evolve with a driver's performance throughout the main portion of their career without excessive volatility.29
* Tier 3 (Elite Driver): K = 10. If a driver's rating has at any point surpassed the elite threshold of 1750, their K-factor is permanently lowered to 10 for all subsequent races, even if their rating later drops below 1750. The skill of an elite driver is well-established and less likely to fluctuate dramatically. A low K-factor ensures that their hard-earned rating is stable and not unduly affected by a single unexpected loss or an isolated poor performance.29
The implementation of this dynamic system is a critical step toward creating a truly expert-level model.
Tier
	Driver Status
	K-Factor Value
	Rationale
	1
	Provisional (First 30 Races)
	40
	Allows for rapid rating convergence for new drivers whose skill level is uncertain.
	2
	Established (Races > 30 AND Rating < 1750)
	20
	Standard value providing a balance of responsiveness and stability for the bulk of a driver's career.
	3
	Elite (Rating has ever exceeded 1750)
	10
	Reduces volatility for top-tier drivers with a proven, stable skill level, making their ratings more robust.
	

4.3. Handling Data Imperfections: A Rulebook for F1's Realities


Real-world motorsport data is inherently messy. Mechanical failures, accidents, and penalties are commonplace. To maintain the integrity and consistency of the Elo system, a clear and comprehensive rulebook for handling these data imperfections is essential.
* DNFs (Did Not Finish): This is the most critical area of nuance. A DNF can occur for reasons related to the car or the driver, and the system must differentiate between them. A high-quality data source with detailed retirement reasons, such as the Ergast API, is indispensable for this task.22
   * Rule 1 (Mechanical/Technical DNFs): Any matchup where one or both teammates retire due to a mechanical failure (e.g., engine, gearbox, hydraulics, electronics) must be excluded. No Elo points are exchanged for that session (Qualifying or Race). It is statistically invalid to penalize a driver for a failure beyond their control.22
   * Rule 2 (Driver Error DNFs): Any matchup where a DNF is attributable to driver error (e.g., crash, collision with another car, spun off) must be included. The driver who caused their own retirement is considered the loser of the duel against their teammate, provided the teammate was classified. This correctly penalizes a driver for a mistake that ended their race.8
* Disqualifications (DSQ): Disqualifications should be treated with similar logic.
   * Rule 3 (Technical DSQ): If a driver is disqualified for a technical infringement (e.g., car being underweight, illegal fuel), the matchup should be excluded. This is a team failure, not necessarily a driver failure.
   * Rule 4 (Sporting DSQ): If a driver is disqualified for an on-track sporting infringement (e.g., causing a severe collision, ignoring flags), this should be treated as a driver error and count as a loss in the matchup.
* Multiple Teammates: On rare historical occasions, a team has entered more than two cars in a race. To prevent an unfair multiplication of Elo points, a driver should not be rewarded for beating multiple teammates as if they were separate, independent victories.
   * Rule 5 (Multiple Teammates): In a scenario with more than two teammates, the Elo exchange should be calculated for each pairwise duel. The total Elo points gained or lost by a driver for that session should then be divided by the number of teammates they competed against. This normalizes the point exchange and maintains fairness.19


Section 5: Bridging the Decades - The Challenge of Cross-Era Comparison


One of the most alluring but treacherous applications of a historical rating system is the comparison of athletes across different eras. While the teammate-comparison model creates a chain that links drivers across decades, inherent statistical challenges make direct, absolute comparisons problematic. It is crucial to understand these limitations and employ strategies to mitigate them, while acknowledging that a perfect cross-era ranking remains statistically elusive.


5.1. The Concepts of Rating Inflation and Deflation


A fundamental property of the Elo system is that a rating is a measure of a competitor's strength relative to the current competition pool in which they are active.1 It is not an absolute measure of skill that can be seamlessly compared across disconnected time periods. Over the 70+ year history of Formula 1, the nature of this competition pool has changed dramatically, leading to the phenomenon of rating inflation.
Rating inflation occurs as the overall skill level of the field rises and new talent enters the system. As new drivers enter at the baseline rating (1500) and compete, the total number of points in the system increases. Over many decades, this can cause the average rating of the entire pool to drift upwards.7 Consequently, a rating of 1700 in 2024 may not represent the same level of dominance over contemporary peers as a 1700 rating did in 1960.
This is the primary statistical reason why the second diagnostic image showed 1950s drivers with extraordinarily high ratings. Their ratings were massively inflated within a small, nascent, and isolated pool and were never properly normalized against the much larger, more competitive, and more accurately rated pools of subsequent decades.8 Therefore, using raw Elo scores to declare that a driver from one era is definitively "better" than a driver from another should be approached with extreme caution. The most accurate and defensible use of this Elo system is to analyze a driver's performance trajectory over their own career or to compare drivers who were contemporaries.32


5.2. Strategies for Normalization and Anchoring


While a perfect solution to cross-era comparison is a subject of ongoing debate among sports statisticians, several methods can be employed to mitigate the effects of rating inflation and make historical comparisons more meaningful.
One pragmatic approach is to perform a periodic normalization of the entire rating pool. At the end of each season, the average Elo rating of all active drivers can be calculated. A simple linear transformation can then be applied to every driver's rating to "re-center" this average back to the initial baseline of 1500. This process prevents the long-term upward drift of ratings and anchors the entire system to a consistent mean over time. While this is an approximation and can slightly distort individual ratings, it is a significant improvement over allowing inflation to run unchecked, making decade-to-decade comparisons more valid.
Ultimately, any cross-era ranking generated by such a system should be viewed as a powerful tool for informed discussion and debate, rather than as a definitive, objective truth.34 It provides a data-driven perspective but cannot fully account for changes in technology, physical demands, and the overall depth of talent in the sport.


5.3. Advanced Alternative: An Introduction to the Glicko System


For those seeking to further enhance the model's sophistication, the Glicko rating system (and its successor, Glicko-2) offers a significant improvement over the standard Elo system, particularly for a sport like Formula 1.35 Developed by Professor Mark Glickman, Glicko builds upon the foundation of Elo by introducing a second crucial variable: the Ratings Deviation (RD).8
The RD is a measure of the uncertainty or reliability of a player's rating. A player with a low RD has a rating that is considered stable and accurate, based on consistent, recent results. A player with a high RD has a more uncertain rating. The key advantage of this is how it handles inactivity. When a player does not compete for a period, their RD increases, reflecting the growing uncertainty about their current skill level.8
This feature is perfectly suited for Formula 1, where drivers often take sabbaticals or retire and later return (e.g., Michael Schumacher, Kimi Räikkönen, Fernando Alonso). In a standard Elo system, their rating remains static during their absence, which is unrealistic. In a Glicko system, their RD would increase significantly during their time away. Upon their return, their rating would be treated as more provisional, and the system would use their higher RD to allow for larger, more rapid rating adjustments in their first few races back. This provides a more accurate and realistic model of a driver's career trajectory and is a logical next step for advancing the F1 rating system.


Section 6: A Blueprint for a Robust F1 Elo System


This concluding section synthesizes the principles and methodologies discussed throughout this report into a clear, actionable blueprint. This step-by-step guide provides a practical framework for implementing a sophisticated and statistically sound Formula 1 driver Elo rating system from the ground up.


6.1. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide


1. Data Acquisition: The foundation of the model is a comprehensive and clean dataset. Source race-by-race results for the entire history of the Formula 1 World Championship (1950-present). This data must include, at a minimum: driver, team, qualifying position, and final race finishing position. Crucially, the dataset must also contain detailed reasons for any Did Not Finish (DNF) classifications to enable the correct application of the DNF rulebook. The Ergast API is an excellent and widely used source for this historical data.22
2. Initialization: Establish a database or data structure to store and manage driver ratings. For each driver, maintain two separate ratings: a Qualifying Elo and a Race Elo. Initialize all drivers competing in the first race of the 1950 season with a starting value of 1500 for both ratings.
3. Chronological Processing: The integrity of the Elo system depends on processing events in the order they occurred. Iterate through every race weekend of every season chronologically, from the 1950 British Grand Prix to the most recent event.
4. Per-Weekend Calculation Loop: For each race weekend in the chronological sequence, perform the following steps:
   * Identify the teammate pairings for each team on the grid.
   * Qualifying Elo Update: For each teammate pairing, apply the data imperfection rulebook (Section 4.3). If the matchup is deemed valid (e.g., no mechanical DNFs for either driver in qualifying), determine the winner based on the higher grid position. Retrieve the current Qualifying Elo for both drivers. Calculate the expected score for the matchup using the Elo formula. Finally, update the Qualifying Elo for both drivers using the rating update formula and the appropriate K-factor from the dynamic, tiered system (Section 4.2).
   * Race Elo Update: For each teammate pairing, apply the data imperfection rulebook again, this time using race results. If the matchup is valid (e.g., no mechanical DNFs, both drivers classified), determine the winner based on the higher finishing position. Retrieve the current Race Elo for both drivers, calculate the expected score, and update their Race Elo ratings using the update formula and the correct dynamic K-factor.
5. Rating Carry-Over: A driver's final Qualifying Elo and Race Elo at the end of a season become their starting ratings for the subsequent season. Any new drivers entering the championship in the next season are initialized at 1500 for both ratings.
6. Global Elo Calculation: At any point in time (e.g., after each race, at the end of each season, or for a final all-time list), the Global Elo for each driver can be calculated using the 30/70 weighted average: Global Elo = (Qualifying Elo * 0.3) + (Race Elo * 0.7).
7. Analysis and Interpretation: With the system fully calculated, generate rankings based on various metrics to provide rich insights. This can include:
   * Current Global Elo rankings for the active grid.
   * All-time rankings based on each driver's peak achieved Global Elo.
   * Specialized rankings based on peak Qualifying Elo (to identify the greatest one-lap specialists) and peak Race Elo (to identify the greatest race-day performers).
